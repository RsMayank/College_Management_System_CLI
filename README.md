# College_Management_System_CLI
Created College Management Systemâ€™s CLI model using C++ Classes and Functions. Used fstream library to create text file as Data Base.
This is not a GUI .
Output of this code will display and list of instruction followed by numbers ie. 1 : Admission 2: Inquiry 3: Feee Detail , User need to input the number written infront of the instruction as an Input.
after a proper input , CLI screen change and enterd to given instructuion folder and will followed by so on.
There is no database. I used text file as an database . if you want to connect database you are free to do so. make sure to clear all the words inside text file so that you get a fresh look.
Text saved in Txt file are not in readable Format.
You are free to use the code. if you want to do so , download the code and press(ctrl + F) and find the word "Mayank" Delete that line, There You Go.
